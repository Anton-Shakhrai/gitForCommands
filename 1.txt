Yesterday - Changes
All my troubles seemed so far away - Changes
Now it looks as though they're here to stay - More Changes
Oh, I believe in yesterday - More Changes
Suddenly - One More Thing
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hangin' over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say - 1st Folder
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday - 1st Folder
