Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Now I need a place to hide away - Anther update
Oh, I believe in yesterday - Anther update
Now I need a place to hide away - Updated
Oh, I believe in yesterday - Updated
